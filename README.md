# cracking-the-coding-interview

These are my solutions to problems in Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [Cracking the Coding Interview (6th edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). Currently all solutions are written in Python. If I feel like it, I may rewrite them in another language (probably Java) once I have gone through them all at least once.

I cannot guarantee perfect or optimal solutions here. Sometimes I will implement a solution and find out it has some issues, but I am too lazy to correct the solution even if I realize what I need to do to fix it. Therefore, if you are looking for reliable solutions to this book, I would suggest referring to [this repository](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition), which has an impressively large group of contributors. They have implemented solutions to these problems in the most prominent languages, such as Python, C, Java, Ruby, Swift, and so forth.

Thank you and have a nice day.
